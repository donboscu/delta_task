Piano tiles Game
Senthil owns a preschool and wants a game that aids in the motor development of kids all the while being fun too! So he proposed a game idea that he wants you to develop into a website.

Game Logic
A random tile of the grid should light up (or any other effects).

If the user clicks on the correct tile, it should proceed to the next round where along with the last round's tiles, one more tile should light up sequentially.

This should continue until the user clicks on one of the wrong tiles or till all tiles of the grid are used.

A demo of the game (normal mode) Demo video here
